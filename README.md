## Important notes
Every hard change or some additions to this project must be declared on this documentation. 
If you haven't some process or workflow clear please send me a request to modify and put the 
necessary information here.

## Project Structure

Every component, data file or modification must be declared on the next directory tree.
If it isn't a confortable process to you, create new README.md in every created directory that 
you need to explain more deeper.

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
For example if we add in `src/parges` a component called `nosotros.astro` the automatic created route by astro will be. `/nosotros`

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
